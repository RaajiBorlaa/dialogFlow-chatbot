    "expertise": "**Professor David Howard** is a distinguished figure at the **University of Salford**, where he holds the position of **Professor of Biomedical Engineering**. His research spans over two decades, focusing on the engineering aspects of **Human Movement and Rehabilitation**. Let me share some key highlights of his work:

    1. **Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)**: Professor Howard leads research in this area, specifically targeting individuals with **partial paralysis** resulting from neurological damage (such as strokes). FES involves stimulating muscles to enhance movement and function.
    
    2. **Prosthetics for Amputees**: His collaborative efforts with colleagues include developing prosthetic solutions for both **upper-limb** and **lower-limb** amputees. This work aims to improve mobility and quality of life.
    
    3. **Biomechanics of Walking Aids**: Professor Howard's expertise extends to studying the biomechanics of walking aids. Understanding how these devices interact with the human body is crucial for effective rehabilitation.
    
    4. **Foot and Lower Limb Biomechanics**: His research delves into the mechanics of the foot and lower limb, contributing valuable insights to assistive device design.
    
    5. **Computational Modeling**: Professor Howard explores **neuro-musculo-skeletal systems** through computational models, enhancing our understanding of movement and rehabilitation.
    
    6. **Real-World Monitoring**: He investigates ways to monitor patients using assistive devices in real-world scenarios.
    
    Professor Howard's interdisciplinary work bridges engineering and health sciences, making a significant impact in the field of rehabilitation. For more details, you can explore his [full profile](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/david-howard) on the University of Salford website. ðŸŒŸ
