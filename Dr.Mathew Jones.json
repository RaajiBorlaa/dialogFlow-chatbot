    1. **Biography and Academic Journey**:
       - Dr. Jones graduated from the University of Salford in **2016**, completing a **BSc in Biomedical Science with Professional Experience**.
       - His academic journey continued with an **MSc by research** at the same institution in **2017**, supervised by **Professor Niroshini Nirmalan**. His research during this period delved into the interplay of **inflammatory cytokines** following major traumatic injury.
       - In **2017**, Dr. Jones embarked on an **industrially funded PhD** under the guidance of **Dr. David Greensmith**. His research focused on investigating the **chemical composition** and **anti-cancer potential** of **Boswellia carterii oleoresins**. During this project, he also explored the impact of traditionally used phytochemicals on **cardiac myocyte function** using advanced epi-fluorescent microscopy techniques.
       - After completing his PhD in **2021**, Dr. Jones transitioned to academia, initially serving as a **senior teaching technician** in Biomedical Science. He later assumed the role of a **Teaching Fellow in Biomedical Science** in December **2021**, and subsequently, he was promoted to his current position as a **Lecturer in Physiology** in **March 2023**¹.
    
    2. **Research Interests**:
       - Dr. Jones's research interests revolve around understanding the therapeutic potential of **novel phytochemicals** and **phytomedicines** for treating conditions such as **cancer**, **infection**, and **inflammation**.
       - He also investigates the **cardiotoxic effects** of phytomedicines at a **single-cell level**.
       - Additionally, Dr. Jones explores the interactions between traditionally used phytomedicines and clinically utilized therapeutics, aiming to enhance effectiveness or mitigate off-target effects¹.
    
    3. **Experimental Expertise**:
       - His experimental skills encompass a range of techniques, including:
         - **Flow cytometry**
         - **Fluorescent and confocal microscopy**
         - **Automated microscopy**
         - **Live cell imaging**
         - **Cell/tissue culture**
         - **Molecular biology techniques**
         - **Analytical chemistry techniques**, including **high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)** and **mass spectrometry**¹.
    
    4. **Teaching and Leadership Roles**:
       - Dr. Jones serves as the **Deputy Programme Leader** for the **Biomedical Science Programme**, with a focus on supporting **level 4 students**.
       - He is also the **Admissions Tutor** for the suite of programs, including **Biomedical Science**, **Human Biology**, and **Infectious Diseases**, along with their associated Foundation years.
       - As a module leader, he oversees the undergraduate modules **Biomedical Skills** and **Human Physiology**. Additionally, he contributes to various other modules across different levels¹.
